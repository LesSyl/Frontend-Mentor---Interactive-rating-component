### What I learned

During the creation of the project, I learned many new things that significantly expanded my programming skills. First and foremost, I understood how to efficiently manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript, such as dynamically adding and removing classes or checking the focus state of elements. I also learned how to use CSS animations to create smooth visual effects, like moving elements at a slow pace. Working with event listeners, particularly focus and blur, helped me better manage user interactions. Additionally, I gained practical experience in code optimization, which makes it easier to scale and keep the code readable.
